# 🕹️ Hangman Game — CodeAlpha Internship Project

A clean, console-based Hangman game built in Python as part of my **CodeAlpha Internship (Python Domain)**.  
This project demonstrates core Python skills including loops, conditionals, data structures, input handling, and modular coding — written with clarity and best practices to ensure it is easy to read, maintain, and extend.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to identify a hidden word one letter at a time.  
The player has **6 wrong attempts**, and each wrong guess gradually draws the hangman figure.

This project is designed for:
- Python beginners building core logic skills  
- Portfolio enhancement  
- Internship task completion  
- Demonstrating clean and structured Python code

## ✨ Features
✔ Randomly selects a word from a predefined list  
✔ Shows correct letters and updates the display in real-time  
✔ Prevents repeated guesses  
✔ Validates input (only single letters allowed)  
✔ Allows 6 incorrect attempts  
✔ Simple and readable ASCII Hangman graphics  
✔ Clear win/lose end messages  
✔ Clean and beginner-friendly code

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Loops (`while`, `for`)
- Conditionals (`if/elif/else`)
- Lists and strings
- Sets (to track guessed letters)
- Input validation
- Random module
- ASCII art handling
- Basic testing concepts

## 🎨 ASCII Hangman Stages  
Each wrong guess reveals one more part of the Hangman — making the game more interactive and fun.

## 🌟 Future Improvements (Optional Enhancements)
These can be added to make it even more impressive:

- Load words from a `.txt` file  
- Difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard)  
- Score tracker  
- Better ASCII art  
- GUI version using Tkinter  
- Web version using Flask
